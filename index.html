    <h1>The Polar Bear</h1>
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <section class="fur">
        <h3>Fur</h3>
        <p>Polar bear fur is made up of a dense, insulating underfur that is topped by guard hairs that vary in length.
            The fur prevents almost all heat loss—in fact, adult males can quickly overheat when they run.
        </p>
        <p>
            And surprisingly, the fur isn’t actually white—it just looks that way. Each hair shaft is pigment-free and
            transparent with a hollow core that scatters and reflects visible light, much like what happens with ice and
            snow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Polar bears look whitest when they are clean and in high-angle sunlight, especially just after the molt
            period, which usually begins in spring and is complete by late summer. Before molting, accumulated oils in
            their fur from the seals they eat can make them look yellow.
        </p>

        <h3>Skin, Ears, and Tail: Staying Warm</h3>
        <p>To keep them warm, polar bears have black skin over a thick layer of fat that can measure up to 11.4
            centimeters (4.49 inches).
        </p>
        <p>
            In the water, they rely more on their fat layer to keep warm; wet fur is a poor insulator. This is why
            mother bears are reluctant to swim with young cubs in the spring—the cubs just don't have enough fat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their skin isn’t the only thing working to keep them warm—their ears are small and round, and their tails
            short and compact, to conserve the most heat possible.

        <h3>Paws and Claws</h3>
        <p>
            Polar bear paws are ideal for roaming the Arctic.
        </p>
        <p>
            They measure up to 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) across, to help polar bears tread on thin ice. When the ice
            is very thin, the bears extend their legs far apart and lower their bodies to distribute their weight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Polar bear paws aren’t designed to help just on land. When swimming, the bear's forepaws act like large
            paddles and its hind paws serve as rudders.
            Black footpads on the bottom of each paw are covered by small, soft bumps known as papillae. Papillae grip
            the ice and keep the bear from slipping. Tufts of fur between its toes and footpads can help with security
            as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            As can their claws. Thick, curved, sharp, and strong—each measures more than five centimeters (1.97 inches)
            long. Polar bears use their claws to catch and hold prey and to gain traction on ice.

        <h3>Size and Weight</h3>
        <p>
            Polar bear paws are ideal for roaming the Arctic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adult males normally weight 350 to more than 600 kilograms (775 to more than 1,300 pounds). Adult females
            are smaller, normally weighing 150 to 290 kilograms (330 to 650 pounds). Researchers in Canada estimated one
            male bear at 800 kilograms (1,700 pounds)!
